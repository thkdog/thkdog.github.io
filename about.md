I'm ShenYi, and I'm experienced in .NET, Java, Android, HTML5 and Javascript (of cource including Node.js).
For now, I'm working as a development mananger of mobile hybrid app(HTML5), and aroused a great interest in Node.js, which is awesome in many aspects.

For any tech chat, feel free to contact me, (thkdog@hotmail.com).
